# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * chore (maintain tools changes)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, …)
#             * perf (A code change that improves performance)
#             * refactor (A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature)
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * merge (merge/pull code)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit    
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not             
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalized first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should answer(72-character wrapped):
#       * Why was this change necessary?
#       * How does it address the problem?
#       * Are there any side effects?
#
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking       
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that   
#    this commit closes
#       * Include a link to the ticket, if any.
#       * BREAKING CHANGE
